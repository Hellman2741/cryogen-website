It is recommended that you use atom-tasks to view TODO files.
Forums:
  ☐ Get new forum logo + read/unread buttons
  ☐ Change 'go social' to an in-game drops feed
  ☐ Table is messed up for market section due to displaying too many items? http://prntscr.com/fe7owu top is expected
Bugs:
  ☐ Logo overlaps navigation button on mobile and it cannot be tapped
General:
  ☐ Reduce as many connections to database as possible
  ☐ Add return false to jquery clicks (forgot...) to prevent page scrolling
  ☐ Switch all error blocks to use the sendAlert instead
Shop:
  ☐ Add 'sort by' option for when there are multiple types of packages (Membership, cosmetic, etc)
Staff Page:
  ☐ Possibly limit searching to either archived/active based on what you were viewing (cuHrrently searches through all)
  ☐ Log all events
  ☐ Reload data for all tabs when a punishment/appeal is acceped. Only refreshes appeal atm
  ☐ Punishment reasons should be added to a 'hover' to avoid long table columns
Account:
Other:
  ☐ Page for players to view their own player/bug reports
  ☐ Better organize all pages (Most pages have different style layouts, as I learned more :p)
  ☐ Make better discord avatar that matches background so it looks transparent
  ☐ Create independant html pages to serve as error pages for nginx
Securiy:
  ☐ Secure all requests to server (though should be secured through sessions already)
  ☐ Update sessions to be more secure. (Create random sess_id and add to database with sess_ids->usernames, allows more than one user to have it)
  ☐ Reset sess_ids when user changes the password
