It is recommended that you use atom-tasks to view TODO files.
Bugs:
  ☐ Logo overlaps navigation button on mobile and it cannot be tapped
General:
  ☐ Cache anything that can be for faster loading
  ☐ Reduce as many connections to database as possible
  ☐ Add a 'Website update in: ' countdown to pages like in-game restart counter
  ☐ Add return false to jquery clicks (forgot...) to prevent page scrolling
  ☐ Switch all error blocks to use the sendAlert instead
Shop:
  ☐ Add 'sort by' option for when there are multiple types of packages (Membership, cosmetic, etc)
Staff Page:
  ☐ Possibly limit searching to either archived/active based on what you were viewing (cuHrrently searches through all)
  ☐ Log all events
  ☐ Reload data for all tabs when a punishment/appeal is acceped. Only refreshes appeal atm

Account:
Other:
  ☐ Page for players to view their own player/bug reports
  ☐ Proper download page
  ☐ Better organize all pages (Most pages have different style layouts, as I learned more :p)
  ☐ Fix possible memory leak
  ☐ Make better discord avatar that matches background so it looks transparent
  ☐ Reduce # of connections to database when loading page
  ☐ Create independant html pages to serve as error pages for nginx
Securiy:
  ☐ Secure all requests to server (though should be secured through sessions already)
  ☐ Update sessions to be more secure. (Create random sess_id and add to database with sess_ids->usernames, allows more than one user to have it)
  ☐ Reset sess_ids when user changes the password
  ✔ Investigate possibly issue in db sess_ids not being correct (find better way to get sess_ids) @done(2017-05-29 04:19) @project(Securiy)
