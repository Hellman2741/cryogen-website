      ☐ Option to give players ability to create second appeal if first is denied (must be requsted, TODO later on)
      ✔ Comment on appeals (viewable by both staff and player) @done(2018-06-11 03:23) @project(Staff Page / Remake TODO / Punishments)
      ✔ Add instructions for searching @done(2018-06-11 03:07) @project(Staff Page / Remake TODO / Punishments)
    Appeals:
      ☐ Load list
      ☐ Searching
      ☐ Filtering through mute/ban/all
      ☐ View archive
      ☐ View punishment from appeal
      ☐ Accept/Deny appeal
Account:
  ☐ Restyle dropdown menu in header
  ☐ Add min/max length requirement to password on account creation/pass changing on server/website
  ☐ Add failsafes in viewings to ensure player can only view their own reports, punishments, etc
Other:
  ☐ Create independant html pages to serve as error pages for nginx
  ☐ Create html pages for emails
  ☐ Create cryogen-rsps.com emails and change webmaster emails + recovery/verification from addresses
Securiy:
  ☐ Add 'password' to recovery statuses only given when you submit + view (id all that is needed and it is sent to client all the time)
API:
  ☐ Add javadoc with requirements for using api endpoints and create/use program to create webpage for them
Highscores:
  ☐ 'Seasonal' highscores page. Different highscores goal each month, random things like nex kills, or chicken kills, bows fletched, etc
  ☐ Banner on left, top option pulls out to reveal all skill icons (this is how highscores is navigated)
  ☐ Main highscore page will have the search for player function
Tracker:
  Full account tracker and basically an online view of your account
  ☐ View quest points, skills, etc
  ☐ Have rendered version of your player in-game
  ☐ Have full adventurer's log hopefully logging as much as you can from in-game. Log can then sort through them, or provide filters to see certain
  ☐ Allow saving of above filters for people who want it to stick throughout sessions/page refreshes
  ☐ Add ability to 'track' up to 5 things, show daily/weekly/monthly stats on said things (quests complete, kills on certain NPC, etc, give stats showing average kills, average quest time, etc)
  ☐ View/Rearrange bank from website (Ponder this for a bit, it'd be kinda insecure in-case of admin account's being hacked, perhaps ONLY players can view, not even staff?)
