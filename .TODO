      ☐ Ensure security with sessions
      ☐ Change 'username' in lists to 'name' cause we actually show display name :p
      ☐ Log all events
      ☐ Same method name on multipe pages is messing with lists on staff page (open all of Reports/Appeals/Punishments, and click View on one of them)
      ☐ Add ability to reload just list from a section, not entire section
    Punishments:
      ☐ Option to give players ability to create second appeal if first is denied (must be requsted, TODO later on)
      ☐ Cannot create new punishment, noty closes when selecting name
    Recoveries:
      ☐ Add stat to see # of times recovered lately
      ☐ Add option to 'lock' account if admin finds recovery suspcious and frequent
      ☐ Add option to send recovery pass/link to discord, forums, pm in-game, or just as a sendAlert on page

  ☐ Add recovery sub-section to account section
  ☐ Restyle dropdown menu in header
  ☐ Add min/max length requirement to password on account creation/pass changing on server/website
  ☐ Add failsafes in viewings to ensure player can only view their own reports, punishments, etc
Other:
  ☐ Create independant html pages to serve as error pages for nginx
Email:
    ✔ Create noreply, anon, cody cryogen.live emails @done(2019-01-10 02:40) @project(Email)
    ✔ Change forum verification + recovery emails to come from noreply email @done(2019-01-10 18:57) @project(Email)
    ☐ Create html pages for emails
Securiy:
  ☐ Add 'password' to recovery statuses only given when you submit + view (id all that is needed and it is sent to client all the time)
  ☐ Change session ids to use local storage instead of cookies
Highscores:
  ☐ 'Seasonal' highscores page. Different highscores goal each month, random things like nex kills, or chicken kills, bows fletched, etc
  ☐ Banner on left, top option pulls out to reveal all skill icons (this is how highscores is navigated)
  ☐ Main highscore page will have the search for player function
Tracker:
  Full account tracker and basically an online view of your account
  ☐ View quest points, skills, etc
  ☐ Have rendered version of your player in-game
  ☐ Have full adventurer's log hopefully logging as much as you can from in-game. Log can then sort through them, or provide filters to see certain
  ☐ Allow saving of above filters for people who want it to stick throughout sessions/page refreshes
  ☐ Add ability to 'track' up to 5 things, show daily/weekly/monthly stats on said things (quests complete, kills on certain NPC, etc, give stats showing average kills, average quest time, etc)
  ☐ View/Rearrange bank from website (Ponder this for a bit, it'd be kinda insecure in-case of admin account's being hacked, perhaps ONLY players can view, not even staff?)
