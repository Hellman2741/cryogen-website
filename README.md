# README #

The Cryogen Website was built by Cody Thompson and Clayton Williams using some open-source templates found online.

### Built in Spark ###

Whilst not entirely necessary, this website was built in Spark (Java) for the purpose of learning.
Jade is used to compile and render templates to html

### Template Files ###

A properties template file has been included (props_.json) for reference. Copy this file, rename and remove the underscore and edit as needed.

An empty SQL export has also been included (database_skeletons.sql), you should only need to import this file into your database, and be set.

### TODO ###

*   Staff section can be rewritten down to like 4-5 files.
*   Finish Paypal transaction management
