# README #

The Cryogen Website was built by Cody Thompson and Clayton Williams using some open-source templates found online.

### Built in Spark ###

Whilst not entirely necessary, this website was built in Spark (Java) for the purpose of learning.
Jade is used to compile and render templates to html

### Missing Files ###

Some files like the forums, and our database configuration files have been removed.
When the website is finished, I will include templates or links for these files.
