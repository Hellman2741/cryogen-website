# README #

The Cryogen Website was built by Cody Thompson and Clayton Williams using some open-source templates found online.

### Built in Spark ###

Whilst not entirely necessary, this website was built in Spark (Java) for the purpose of learning.
Jade is used to compile and render templates to html

### Template Files ###

A properties template file has been included [props_.json](data/props_.json) for reference. Copy this file, rename and remove the underscore and edit as needed.

An empty SQL export has also been included [database_skeleton.sql](data/database_skeleton.sql), you should only need to import this file into your database, and be set.
```Please note this export requires at least MySQL v5.6.5.```

Should either of these files end up out of date, please let me know and I will be sure to update them.

### TODO ###

A link to the TODO file can be found [here](.TODO).

[atom-tasks](https://github.com/irrationalistic/atom-tasks) is a good package to use for viewing TODO files.
